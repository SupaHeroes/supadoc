# Active Collective

Supaheroes uses an experimental [Active Collective Funding Algorithm](https://axeldevara.medium.com/active-collective-funding-using-game-theory-to-fund-public-goods-54c92f6fd04e) to distribute grants dynamically based on market behavior. The algorithm is loosely based on [cooperative game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_game_theory).

## How Active Collective model works

In a nutshell, the whole process works like the following:

- Public goods project owners apply for the grant with informations about their projects and their funding goal.
- A portion of the treasury fund will be distributed into several pools. E.g. $100K of the fund goes to climate change pool.
- The DAO choose/vote and validate 5-10 (subject to change) projects for each pools.
- Supporters may contribute to those projects for a duration of time.
- Total contributions, goal, and the campaign performance compared to others affects the final matching outcome.

## Factors that affect the final matching outcome

- How close a project to it's goal will
- How a project contribution performs compared to others
- Contribution volume accross all projects

## Outcome scenarios

- A project dominates others in contribution volume will receive most of the funds from the funding pool
- All projects reach or close to their goals means most of the funds are unlocked and splitted equally based on goals ratio
- All projects are doing horribly(low amount of contributions) means most of the funds are still locked in the pool

## Is this meant to replace CLR model?

** NO! **

The active collective model is here only to provide an alternative perspective on how we should fund the public goods. In general, rather than viewing quantity of votes as an indicator of public preference, this system focuses on the value of votes while also taking market condition into consideration. In order to do important decision such as let the public allocate large amount of funds, there are debates whether we should give the voting power to everyone or only those who actually understand both the product and its value to society. This debate has existed since the Socrates era and none are either wrong or false.


## When will you have your first test run?

We will start ETA June 2022
