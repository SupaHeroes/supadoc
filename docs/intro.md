# Intro

Let's discover **Supaheroes in less than 10 minutes**.

## What is Supaheroes?

Supaheroes is a decentralized crowdfunding ecosystem for both private and public goods. It consists not only of a blockchain application, but also a live community of philanthropists, investors, business owners, blockchain developers, and also enthusiasts!

Whether you are a hobbyist or a business owner, start and grow your projects in Supaheroes ecosystem to gain access to the latest crowdfunding innovations on the blockchain. Eventhough the challenges are unpredictable, being successfully funded by your fans is a way better start than getting a loan from the bank because not only you get the funds you require, you also gain more fans and be able to test the market without overhead price. According to [statistics](https://www.statista.com/statistics/235405/kickstarter-project-funding-success-rate/), only **4/10** projects had successful funding in 2021. Through DeFi, we are looking to increase that number to at least **6/10** and this docs will explain how.

## How does Supaheroes help both private and public goods projects?

Supaheroes have 2 main campaign models. The first one is the [reward-based campaign model](/reward-based-campaign/intro) which is very popular among both profit and non-profit organizations. Basically, a project receive funds from the crowd and in return, the crowd receive rewards from the project which could range from early products sample, early access, or even tokens! Everyone will be able to create and run reward-based campaigns at any time of the year.

Secondly, every specified month in the year, there will be a [grant campaign model](/grant/active-collective) which will be created for funding public goods. This model requires a pool of funds from the fee gathered from successful reward-based campaigns. The grant model is still in development and will require a DAO prior to it's first run.
