# Intro

Let's discover **Supaheroes in less than 10 minutes**.

## What is Supaheroes?

Supaheroes is a decentralized crowdfunding ecosystem which targets environmental organizations looking to fund projects and people from all over the world that want to support these environmental organizations. The ecosystem provides necessary infrastructure to deploy a decentralized crowdfunding project in a way that fits both projectstarters as projectsupporters. Projectstarters get battle-tested smart contracts to start a crowdfunding campaign for their project and access to the Supaheroes platform with a vibrant community of philanthropists, investors, business owners, blockchain developers, and other environmental enthusiasts! 
For projectsupporters the platform offers a clear view of different projects and an easy way to support the project of your choice! With the initial deployment on Gnosis chain low transaction fees, a fiat on- and offramp and a high security blockchain are assured.


So whether you are a hobbyist or a business owner, start and grow your projects in Supaheroes ecosystem to gain access to the latest crowdfunding innovations on the blockchain. Eventhough the challenges are unpredictable, being successfully funded by your fans is a way better start than getting a loan from the bank because not only you get the funds you require, you also gain more fans and be able to test the market without overhead price. According to [statistics](https://www.statista.com/statistics/235405/kickstarter-project-funding-success-rate/), only **4/10** projects had successful funding in 2021. Through DeFi, we are looking to increase that number to at least **6/10** and this docs will explain how.

## How does Supaheroes help both private and public goods projects?

Supaheroes have 2 main campaign models. The first one is the [reward-based campaign model](/reward-based-campaign/intro) which is very popular among both profit and non-profit organizations. Basically, a project receives funds from the crowd and in return, the crowd receives rewards from the project which could range from early products sample, early access, or even tokens! Everyone will be able to create and run reward-based campaigns at any time of the year.

Secondly, every specified month in the year, there will be a [grant campaign model](/grant/active-collective) which will be created for funding public goods. This model requires a pool of funds from the fee gathered from successful reward-based campaigns. The grant model is still in development and will require a DAO prior to it's first run.
