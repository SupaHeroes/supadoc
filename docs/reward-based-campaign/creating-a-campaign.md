# Creating a campaign

Creating a reward based campaign is easy on Supaheroes. As a project owner, all you need is a plan and detailed information about your project to explain to your supporters. 

## Choose Mode

To create a Supaheroes campaign, you will sign 2-3 smart contracts depending on which mode you choose:

People will trust a vested campaign more than non-vested campaign

- [Vested Campaign](/reward-based-campaign/vested-campaign) (Recommended)
    - The campaign contract
    - Reward manager contract
    - Vesting manager contract

- Non-Vested Campaign
    - The campaign contract
    - Reward manager contract

## Project Details

Provide a full information for your supporters and let them understand what you are building. The forms will be very straight-forward, you will be guided by the instructions. 

note: We will not store any informations about your project! Your project details will be stored on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)

## Reward Manager Settings

You will be asked to specify how you want to distribute the NFT receipt to your users. You will be able to set how much they need to contribute in order to get a certain reward. E.g. for $500 contribution, you will send your product sample.

You may also provide **your own NFT receipt design** to provide a more unique experience for your supporters.

## Vesting Manager Settings

You will be asked on how the collected funds be allocated. Should you want to provide more trust to your supporters, you might set the funds to be claimed *per-milestone* basis.
