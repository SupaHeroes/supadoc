# Introduction

Reward based campaign is a crowdfunding campaign system in which you are able to receive a reward based on the amount of your contribution. This system is not only perfect for private goods projects, but also charities. 

As a contributor, you will receive an NFT as a prove of your contribution as well as the rights to dispute in case a project turns out to be a scam. The mechanism will be explained in detail in the **Self-dispute** section of the docs.

As a project owner, you will be able to get funded using the latest DeFi technologies. What does this mean? It means you will be able to receive not only USD currency but also cryptocurrency that earns you interest along the campaign process resulting a bigger fund for your project by the end of your campaign. On top of that, you will also be able to launch a campaign without any paperwork, your supporters will be the one judging your legitimacy.
