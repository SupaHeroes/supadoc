# Self-dispute

Self-dispute is a mechanism we built based on NFT technology. Upon contributing to a project, users are awarded with NFT receipt as a proof of contribution. You may use this receipt to vote if a project is found to be a fraud. Once a consensus of 40% is reached, the campaign will stop and you will be able to refund your money back.

This is a new way to securely contribute in this trustless and KYC-less environment where rug-pull crimes are very common. As long as you have the NFT receipt, you will have power over the campaign you contributed. 

## If it's an NFT will I be able to sell it?

**YES!**

You have 100% rights on however you want to do with your NFT. This is why we think reward based campaign is exciting! Since receipts are scarce, a very popular project might have their receipts out of stock. Thus, creating a secondary market opportunity for supporters to sell their receipt to someone else.

## How will i know the project turns out to be a scam?

It is recommended that you should always choose a project with vesting agreement. Vesting provides extra security to your contribution money.

On top of that, you are supposed to have many days left before the campaign ends.

## What do I do if the campaign has ended?

Once the campaign ends, your NFT receipt will be worthless in the secondary market. However, don't forget that each receipt is a proof of contribution! You may follow your contributed project's steps to calim your reward. Your eligibility to claim reward is stored in the NFT and no one will be able to change that.

Once the reward has been claimed, your NFT receipt will convert itself into a Certificate and hey! It will also be an NFT! The difference though, you will be able to write your name on it. You may keep your certificate as a memory of your humble contribution.
