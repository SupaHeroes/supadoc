# Vesting

Vesting provides security for contributors by restricting campaign owners from taking all the collected funds at once after the campaign ends. Instead, the collected funds are gradually made claimable based on the specified milestones/dates.

This is an **optional feature**, project owners will be given an option to opt for vesting or not.

:::tip
Vested campaigns will perform better than non-vested campaign as they provide more sense of security for contributors
